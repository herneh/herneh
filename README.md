**Herneh Kapustanke** is my language universe . It consists of several manifestations you can marvel at on the following GitHub Pages:
- [йylme](https://herneh.github.io/jylme/) — my private[^1] notes on the Mari language (*марий йылме*, Glottocode: [east2328](https://glottolog.org/resource/languoid/id/east2328), ISO 639-3: [mhr](https://iso639-3.sil.org/code/mhr)), along with bits of information about a few other languages that Iʼm interested in. Go and have a look if you read in Polish. Opinions, comments and corrections are welcome; there is a contact page there.
- [овда курык](https://herneh.github.io/ovda-kuryk/) — this one is my latest. I have a general idea about its purpose, but I still need to figure out some structural details. Stay tuned!
- [my sauna has been struck by lightning](https://herneh.github.io/uralic-phrasebook/) — a phrasebook (or rather: a book of sentences) in Uralic languages. It is a collaborative project, so go there and check if and how you can help, if youʼre interested.
- …and some more coming soon.

Welcome to **Herneh Kapustanke**. My name is Piotr. Enjoy your reading!
