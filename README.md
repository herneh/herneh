Welcome to **Herneh Kapustanke**. Iʼm Piotr and Iʼm based in Wrocław, Polska.

**Herneh Kapustanke** is my private language universe, ‘private’ as in ‘my own’ or ‘idiosyncratic’, not as in ‘secret’ (otherwise I wouldnʼt put it online, right?). It consists of several manifestations you can marvel at on the following GitHub Pages:
- [йylme](https://herneh.github.io/jylme/) — my personal notes on the Mari language (mhr, марий йылме), along with bits of information about a few other languages that Iʼm interested in.
- [my sauna has been struck by lightning](https://herneh.github.io/uralic-phrasebook/) — a phrasebook (or rather a book of sentences) in Uralic languages. Itʼs a collaborative project, so go there and check if and how you can help, if youʼre interested.
