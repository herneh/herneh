**HERNEH KAPUSTANKE** is my language universe. It consists of several manifestations you can have a look at on the following GitHub Pages:
- [йylme](https://herneh.github.io/jylme/) — a home for my private notes on one particular language, along with bits of information about a few other languages that I am interested in.
- [овда курык](https://herneh.github.io/ovda-kuryk/) — where I am converting two PDFs into HTML files for easy online access.
- [my sauna has been struck by lightning](https://herneh.github.io/uralic-phrasebook/) — a phrasebook (or rather: a book of sentences) in Uralic languages.
- …and some more coming soon.

Enjoy your reading.
